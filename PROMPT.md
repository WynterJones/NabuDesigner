# PROMPT.md — "Generate a template for X"

The single brief + playbook for spinning up a new premium landing-page template.
Say **"Generate a template for X"** (X = the offer/niche/product) and an agent
runs this file end-to-end: brief → brand → mockup → assets → motion → QA, ending
with a finished, self-contained `templates/<slug>/` folder that opens in a browser.

Read first (they are the law): `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`,
`skills/landing-page-design-process/SKILL.md`,
`skills/entertainment-designer/SKILL.md`, `tools/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`.

---

## How to use this file

1. **Fill in the Brief block below** (Part 1). Anything you leave blank, the agent
   infers and **labels the assumption** — it never blocks on missing detail except
   the few hard questions in Part 2.
2. Hand the agent: *"Generate a template for X — follow PROMPT.md."* (Or just say
   "Generate a template for X"; `CLAUDE.md` points here.)
3. The agent executes Parts 3–7 and reports the finished folder + how to QA it.

You do **not** copy this file into the template. It stays at the repo root as the
reusable kickoff brief. The per-template repurposing brief is the template's own
`LLM.md` (see `templates/fishing-cinematic/LLM.md`).

## Part 1 — The Brief (fill this in)

Copy this block, fill what you know, leave the rest for the agent to infer.

```

## Part 2 — Clarify only if blank (max ~3 questions)

Ask the user **only** when a blank would change the whole build. Otherwise infer +
label. The questions worth asking:

1. **Offer + price + primary CTA label** — if there's no offer at all, you can't
   write the page.
2. **Mood/medium** (dark-cinematic vs bright vs flat-vector…) — drives the entire
   style signature and every asset.
3. **fal vs baseline** — only if `.env`'s `FAL_KEY` presence is unclear (check it;
   if present, default to fal).

Everything else: assume something reasonable, write it into the copy, and note the
assumption in the template README. Do not interrogate.

---

## Part 3 — Pick a layout archetype (force variety)

**Two templates must never feel like the same skeleton recolored.** Before
building, choose an architecture that fits the niche *and differs from existing
siblings* in `templates/`. Glance at what's there, then pick a different shape:

| Archetype        | Feels like                | Good for                        |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Full-bleed cinematic | video hero, scene bands, dark | courses, experiences, flagship offers |
| Bento / UI grid  | tiles, device mockups, chips | SaaS, apps, dashboards          |
| Split-screen     | 50/50 image\|copy, alternating | products, services, comparisons |
| Editorial / long-form | magazine columns, big type | stories, info products, coaching |
| Card-driven      | stacked feature cards, carousels | marketplaces, bundles, catalogs |
| Timeline / steps | vertical journey, progress | methods, programs, onboarding   |

Then vary *within* it too: don't reuse the same section order each build. Lead
with image/video, not headlines. Large accent graphics do the design work.

## Part 4 — Execute the four stages

Start from the scaffold, then run the process from
`skills/landing-page-design-process/SKILL.md`. Honor `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`
throughout.

```bash
cp -r templates/_blank templates/<slug>
```

### Stage 0 — Brand (lock before any page art)
- Fill `brand/brand.json`: `name`, `tagline`, real-hex `palette`, `type`, a fixed
  `seed`, and the one **`styleSignature`** sentence — *medium, lighting, exact
  palette hexes, texture, mood; end with "No text, no words, no letters."* This
  string is prepended to **every** image prompt and is the consistency mechanism.
- Set `engines` to match `fidelity` (fal vs gemini).
- Generate brand assets: `brand/logo.png`, `brand/logo-mark.png`,
  `brand/favicon.png`, `brand/style-board.webp` (generate on solid white →
  `imgkit keyout` / `webp` / `favicon`).
- Build `brand/styleguide.html` (logo, palette, type, icons, scene, CTA together;
  no footer). Reference: `templates/fishing-course-local-lake/brand/styleguide.html`.
- **Gate:** real palette + concrete signature; logo/mark/favicon are true-
  transparent PNGs that read on light *and* dark; styleguide opens with every
  asset loading.

### Stage 1 — Mockup & sales architecture (build all sections before polish)
- Write `index.html` + `assets/styles.css` (colors derived from `brand.json`
  `:root` vars — one source of truth) in the chosen archetype.
- Full persuasive copy per `persuasionStyle`. For long-form, use the beats: promise
  → painful state → new mechanism → story → what you get → why it works → offer
  stack → risk reversal → urgency → FAQ → final CTA.
- One promise per section, one CTA per zone; main CTA in hero, mid-page, offer
  stack, and final section — all wired to `ctaTarget`.
- **Declare every image as a slot in `assets/prompts/manifest.json`** (id, type,
  subjectPrompt, post step, out path) before the files exist. HTML can reference
  the paths early.
- **Gate:** page reads top-to-bottom, no lorem, every section has a purpose,
  manifest lists every image the page references.

### Stage 2 — Asset generation & visual polish
- Generate each manifest asset as `styleSignature + subjectPrompt`, then run its
  `post` step. Scenes → `webp`; icons/logo/chrome → generate on solid white →
  `keyout` to transparent. Save originals to `raw/`, finals to `assets/img/`.
- Generate the **icon set with one shared descriptor** so they read as siblings.
- **Full-image CTA buttons**: one AI graphic per label (Ideogram → `keyout`),
  label in the `<img alt>`, only hover/press/glow in CSS. Art-direct the button
  (don't accept default candy-gloss) — see the entertainment-designer skill.
- Generate ALL chrome (checks, arrows, play, stars, badges, seals) as image
  assets. **No emojis. No hand-authored/invented SVG icon art.** CSS only for
  layout primitives.
- **Read every generated file and eyeball it; regenerate any dud** (generic,
  washed-out, cluttered; buttons that wrap, go two-tone, recolor, or typo).
- **Gate:** first viewport has strong on-brand imagery; CTAs have hover/focus;
  logo/icons/scenes/CTA share one look; no fallback placeholders; works from disk.
  **Contrast:** every button label (CSS *and* the image-CTA's baked-in
  lettering) reads AA on its own fill — gold/pastel fills take dark ink, no
  gold-on-gold or white-on-cream; the logo/wordmark and any badge/seal overlay
  number read on both their light and dark placements.

### Stage 3 — Motion, detail & QA
- Layer restrained motion: scroll reveal/stagger, parallax, sticky bar, count-ups,
  particle/orb fields, glow, micro-interactions, mascot bob. Vanilla JS + CSS,
  60fps (transform/opacity only), all honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Video for **variety, not wallpaper**: a signature loop + vertical-video cards +
  animated accent areas — don't background-video every section. **Modals embed a
  real YouTube video**, never a generated clip.
- Polish: `text-wrap: balance` on headings, no orphan words (`&nbsp;` trailing
  phrases, intentional `<br>`), themed scrollbar, focus rings, selection color.
- **Gate:** no horizontal overflow at 360 / 768 / 1280; AA contrast; videos
  autoplay/muted/loop with posters; modals close on Esc/×/click-outside; all CTA
  links, FAQ toggles, asset paths, favicon work; the folder copies as a standalone.

## Part 5 — Tool cheat-sheet (fal tier)

```bash
# scene / hero still -> webp
python3 tools/fal.py image --prompt "<styleSignature + subject>" --aspect 16:9 --seed <SEED> --out raw/hero.jpg
python3 tools/imgkit.py webp raw/hero.jpg assets/img/hero.webp --max 1920

# looping video (run in background, 1-5 min) -> web-weight + poster
python3 tools/fal.py video --image raw/hero.jpg --duration 5 --aspect 16:9 \
  --prompt "<looping idle: named layers that move + parallax, seamless loop>" --out raw/hero.mp4
python3 tools/vidkit.py web    raw/hero.mp4 assets/video/hero.mp4 --max 1280
python3 tools/vidkit.py poster raw/hero.mp4 assets/video/hero-poster.jpg

# logo / icon / seal: generate on SOLID WHITE -> key transparent
python3 tools/imgkit.py keyout raw/logo.jpg brand/logo.png       --fuzz 30 --trim --pad 56 --size 640
python3 tools/imgkit.py keyout raw/ic-x.jpg assets/img/ic-x.png  --fuzz 30 --trim --pad 36 --size 256
python3 tools/imgkit.py favicon brand/logo.png brand/favicon.png --size 256

# full-image CTA button (Ideogram) -> keyout. SHORT one-line label, art-directed.
python3 tools/fal.py image --model fal-ai/ideogram/v3 --aspect 3:1 \
  --prompt "<art-directed button>, ultra-wide rounded-rectangle filling frame, ONE single line bold text reading exactly '<LABEL>', one continuous brand colour (no stripes/two-tone/seam), plain pure white background, no emoji, no extra icons/punctuation." \
  --out raw/btn-hero.jpg
python3 tools/imgkit.py keyout raw/btn-hero.jpg assets/img/btn-hero.png --fuzz 44 --trim --pad 8
```

**Baseline tier (no FAL_KEY):** use the `imagegen` MCP — Gemini
`model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image"` for scenes/icons/logo (on white → `keyout`),
Replicate Flux 1.1 Pro for photoreal. See `tools/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` (and its known
issues — Gemini model id, no real transparency, gpt-image-1 broken).

---

## Part 6 — QA locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8771      # from repo root
# open http://localhost:8771/templates/<slug>/index.html
```

Check at 360 / 768 / 1280: no horizontal overflow, videos autoplay/loop with
posters, buttons crisp (no wrap/two-tone/typo), icons/seal clean, host modal opens
and closes (Esc/×/click-outside, iframe `src` cleared on close), no orphan words,
AA contrast, no dead CTAs, favicon loads.

---

## Part 7 — Wrap up

- Write the template's `README.md` (what it is, what stands out, how the art was
  made, the folder shape) — pattern: `templates/fishing-cinematic/README.md`.
- Write the template's `LLM.md` repurposing brief so the next niche can reuse it —
  pattern: `templates/fishing-cinematic/LLM.md`.
- Report: the finished `templates/<slug>/` path, the QA command, any labeled
  assumptions, and any assets that needed regeneration.

---

## The bar (don't ship below it)

Graphics-led, low-text, marketing-focused. Every asset passes the glance test —
instant impact, strong focal point, rich color, readable silhouette. Full-image AI
CTA buttons, no emojis, no invented SVG icon art. Layout varies from its siblings.
Motion feels expensive, not busy. **Contrast is non-negotiable:** every button
label, card/section text, logo, and badge/seal overlay reads AA against its own
surface (not the page) — see DESIGN_GUIDELINES §2. If anything looks generic,
washed-out, cluttered, low-contrast, or a button is inconsistent — regenerate it. The page reads as a premium,
graphics-led marketing experience, not a document.
