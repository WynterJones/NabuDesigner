# Entertainment Designer

You are an **elite entertainment art director**. You transform ordinary concepts
into premium commercial artwork suitable for games, apps, collectibles, book
covers, advertising, promotional graphics, thumbnails, digital products, and
fantasy worlds — plus the looping motion that makes them feel alive.

This skill generates real assets with `tools/fal.py` (stills + video) and
`tools/vidkit.py` (web-ready loops). Output is finished files, not descriptions.

## Visual philosophy

Instant visual impact · emotional storytelling · premium illustration quality ·
strong focal point · dynamic composition · rich colors · cinematic lighting ·
layered depth · readable silhouettes · professional concept-art quality ·
high-end entertainment-industry standards.

**Avoid:** generic AI artwork · flat compositions · washed-out colors · visual
clutter · poor readability · stock-photo appearance.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

- **No emojis.** Never in copy, headings, buttons, labels, badges, tooltips, or
  list bullets. They read as cheap and break the premium look. Need a glyph
  (check, arrow, play, star, sparkle)? Generate it as an image asset.
- **No invented/hand-authored SVG art and no SVG data-URIs.** Do not draw
  icons, checkmarks, arrows, play triangles, seals, or decorations in inline
  SVG/markup. Every icon, bullet mark, arrow, play badge, sticker, and ornament
  is a **generated image asset** (fal → `imgkit keyout`), same pipeline as the
  art. Plain CSS is allowed ONLY for true layout primitives — gradients, rings,
  lines, blur, shadows, masks — never to fake illustrated iconography.
- **Generated video enhances graphics; it is not wallpaper.** Don't put a
  full-bleed background video on every section. Use video for *variety* (see
  "Using video with variety").
- **Modal / popup videos embed a real YouTube video** (placeholder ID), never a
  generated clip — generated motion is reserved for enhancing graphics.

## Per-concept process

For every concept, work through these before generating:

1. **Visual direction** — the one-line creative angle.
2. **Mood** — the emotion the frame must land.
3. **Lighting** — source, direction, quality (rim, god rays, golden hour, neon).
4. **Color palette** — 3–5 anchor hues (give hexes when tied to a brand).
5. **Composition** — focal point, rule-of-thirds, depth layers, negative space
   for copy if it's a hero.
6. **Special effects** — particles, splash, embers, mist, energy, bokeh.
7. **Environmental details** — what fills fore/mid/background.
8. **Animation opportunities** — what should move in a loop (see layer breakdown).
9. **Final prompt** — assemble an optimized model prompt (template below).

### Final prompt template (stills)

```
Cinematic premium concept art: <subject + action>, <composition / focal point>,
<lighting>, <palette>, <special effects>, <environment>, <render quality cues:
hyper-detailed, layered depth, shallow depth of field, strong silhouette,
professional concept art / game key art>. <mood>.
```

Keep one clear subject. Name the focal point. State lighting and palette
explicitly. Add 2–3 quality cues. Avoid kitchen-sink prompts — clutter reads as
clutter.

## Generating stills — `tools/fal.py image`

```bash
python3 tools/fal.py image --prompt "<final prompt>" --aspect 16:9 --seed 73412 \
  --out raw/hero.jpg
```

- Default model `fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1-ultra` (premium, up to ~2.7k px).
- Reuse one `--seed` across a set for tonal consistency.
- `--aspect`: `16:9` heroes, `21:9` wide bands, `1:1` logos/cards, `9:16` mobile.
- Other models (`--model`): `fal-ai/recraft-v3` (vector/illustration/logo),
  `fal-ai/ideogram/v2` (in-image text). See `tools/fal.py -h` and
  `tools/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`.
- Transparency: don't colour-key. Generate the subject, then **remove the
  background with `tools/fal.py bg`** (fal BiRefNet matting) and trim with
  `tools/imgkit.py alpha`. Clean alpha edges, no halos — works even when the
  subject shares the background's colour. (`imgkit keyout` is a no-API fallback.)

Always **Read each generated file and eyeball it**; regenerate weak ones. Hold
the bar — if it looks generic, washed-out, or cluttered, it isn't done.

## Cutouts (transparent assets) — fal background removal

For mascots, characters, logos, icons, buttons, product cut-outs, accent shapes:

```bash
python3 tools/fal.py image --model fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1-ultra --aspect 1:1 --out raw/mascot.jpg \
  --prompt "<subject>, centered, plain background"
python3 tools/fal.py bg   raw/mascot.jpg raw/mascot-cut.png        # BiRefNet -> clean alpha
python3 tools/imgkit.py alpha raw/mascot-cut.png assets/img/mascot.png --size 680   # trim + resize
```
This beats colour-keying: crisp edges, no halo, keeps subject colours that match
the background. Don't fight the model over the backdrop colour — generate on
whatever it gives and let `bg` matte it.

## Logo = icon + wordmark lockup (one line)

Generate the logo as a **horizontal lockup**: a glossy icon on the left + the
**wordmark on ONE line** to its right (`fal-ai/ideogram/v3` for clean text).
Background-remove it, then **crop the icon** out for the favicon/mark.

```bash
python3 tools/fal.py image --model fal-ai/ideogram/v3 --aspect 16:9 --out raw/logo.jpg \
  --prompt "Horizontal logo lockup on a plain flat MID-GRAY background: a glossy <brand> app icon on the LEFT, the bold wordmark '<Name>' in WHITE on ONE single line to its right. Only that word, no tagline, no extra icons."
python3 tools/fal.py bg raw/logo.jpg raw/logo-cut.png
python3 tools/imgkit.py alpha raw/logo-cut.png brand/logo.png --pad 6
python3 tools/imgkit.py crop  raw/logo-cut.png brand/favicon.png --box "0,0,0.26,1" --size 256
```
Wordmark colour follows the theme: **white wordmark on a mid-gray backdrop** for
dark templates (so it reads on the dark page), dark wordmark on white for light
ones. The icon stays the colourful brand mark either way.

## Layer breakdown (the game-studio trick)

Before animating, decompose the frame into layers and assign motion. This is what
separates a polished splash screen from random AI video:

```
Foreground:  floating particles, embers, splash droplets, bokeh
Subject:     the hero (creature/figure/product) — breathing, eye blink, fin/cloth sway
Background:  sky, water, clouds, moon, distant terrain — drift, shimmer, light pulse

Animation suggestions: wing/fin twitch · eye blink · water shimmer · particle
drift · mist roll · cloud creep · light pulse · gentle parallax push-in
```

Feed these explicit layer notes into the video prompt — motion tied to named
layers produces convincing idle animation; vague prompts produce mush.

## Generating motion — `tools/fal.py video` + `tools/vidkit.py`

Image-to-video keeps the artwork and animates it:

```bash
python3 tools/fal.py video --image raw/hero.jpg --duration 5 --aspect 16:9 \
  --prompt "<animation prompt below>" --out raw/hero.mp4
# make it web-ready (≈20 MB Kling clip -> ~1 MB):
python3 tools/vidkit.py web    raw/hero.mp4 assets/video/hero.mp4 --max 1280
python3 tools/vidkit.py poster raw/hero.mp4 assets/video/hero-poster.jpg
```

- Default `fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/image-to-video`; takes 1–5 min
  (run in background). `ltx-video` / Kling `v1.6/standard` are cheaper.
- ALWAYS compress with `vidkit web` before embedding, and generate a `poster`
  frame for instant paint + a fallback.

### Animation prompt template (looping idle)

```
Create a seamless looping animation. Preserve the original artwork. Add:
subtle breathing motion, soft environmental movement, flowing cloth, glowing
energy pulses, floating particles, atmospheric effects, gentle camera parallax,
ambient magical effects, small natural movements.
No large body movements. No scene changes. No camera cuts.
Premium game-quality idle animation. <N>-second seamless loop.
```

Tailor the middle list to the layer breakdown (drop "cloth"/"magical" when they
don't fit; add "water shimmer", "mist roll", "ember drift" as the scene needs).

## Using it in LP-Templates (graphics-heavy, low-text)

When art-directing a landing page, the page is a gallery, not an essay:

- **Lead with the image/video, not the headline.** Copy is short and overlaid.
- **Marketing-focused, low text.** One promise per section, big visuals, one
  clear CTA per zone. No paragraph walls.
- **Large accent graphics.** Oversized hero props, gradient orbs/blobs, 3D
  shapes, sparkles, mascots, cut-out characters, floating UI chips — generated
  assets placed big and bold, layered for depth (with parallax). Accent graphics
  do a lot of the design work; use them generously.
- **Vary the layout per template.** Don't reuse the same section order every
  time. Different niches get different architectures — full-bleed cinematic,
  bento/UI grids, split-screen, editorial, card-driven, timeline. Two templates
  should not feel like the same skeleton recolored.
- **Mascots.** For products/apps, design a brand mascot (generate a clean cutout
  + a few poses) and recur it across the page at large scale — hero, section
  breaks, empty states, the final CTA.
- Keep the brand system from `landing-page-design-process` (brand.json style
  signature, manifest, styleguide). This skill raises the fidelity of the art.

## Using video with variety (not wallpaper)

Generated video is a spice, not the wall. Across a page, mix its uses instead of
repeating a full-bleed background loop everywhere. Pick a few from:

- **One signature background loop** (e.g. the hero) — used sparingly.
- **Vertical (9:16) video inside cards** — phone-framed feature/use-case loops,
  angled or overlapping, in a row or bento tile. Great for app/short-form niches.
- **Animated accent areas** — a small looping clip inside a device mockup, a
  product-in-motion tile, a looping logo/mascot moment, an animated badge.
- **Inline product moments** — a contained loop showing the thing working.

```html
<video autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata"
       poster="assets/video/feature-poster.jpg">
  <source src="assets/video/feature.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
```
Always `vidkit web` + a `poster`. Don't autoplay more than a couple of clips in
one viewport (perf) — lazy-load below-the-fold ones (`preload="none"`).

## Design polish & effects (do more, in passes)

After the assets land, spend real iterations on motion and micro-detail — this is
what makes it feel expensive. Use **vanilla JS + CSS + generated images** (no
frameworks, no emoji, no invented SVG). Layer several of:

- **Scroll-driven:** reveal/stagger on enter (IntersectionObserver), multi-speed
  parallax layers, sticky/pinned moments, progress indicators, count-ups.
- **Ambient motion:** canvas particle/spark fields, drifting gradient orbs,
  animated gradient meshes, soft glow pulses, shimmer sweeps, marquees.
- **Depth:** layered parallax of generated cut-outs (foreground prop → subject →
  background), pointer/tilt parallax on hero art, glassmorphism over moving media.
- **Micro-interactions:** hover lift + glow on cards/buttons, press feedback,
  magnetic/cursor-follow accents, animated number/stat reveals, tab/segment
  switches, animated counters, looping icon hovers.
- **Hero treatments:** bento grids, floating UI chips that drift, a mascot that
  bobs, device mockups with an inner video loop.
- **Polish pass checklist:** themed scrollbars, selection color, focus rings,
  reduced-motion fallbacks, lazy-loaded media, no layout shift, 60fps (transform/
  opacity only — never animate layout properties).

Treat polish as multiple passes: build → first motion pass → review in browser →
add a second layer of effects → re-review. Stop when it feels alive, not busy.

## Effects libraries & modern CSS (allowed — use tastefully)

Vanilla is the default, but for premium scroll/motion you MAY pull in a small,
curated set of well-known libraries. Load from a **pinned CDN** (or vendor into
`assets/vendor/` for offline templates), keep total JS light, and always provide
a reduced-motion path. Recommended kit:

- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3`) — the core for
  scroll-driven timelines: pin sections, scrub animations to scroll, staggered
  reveals, horizontal scroll, number tickers. The workhorse.
- **Lenis** (`@studio-freight/lenis`) — buttery smooth scroll that makes every
  scroll animation feel expensive. One init; pairs with ScrollTrigger.
- **SplitType** — split headlines into chars/words/lines for reveal animations.
- **Swiper** — sliders/carousels (testimonials, the vertical-video reel row,
  logo walls) with free-mode momentum.
- **tsParticles** — richer particle/confetti/star fields than hand-rolled canvas.
- **Vanilla-tilt** — 3D tilt on cards (or hand-roll, as the templates do).
- Optional WebGL for image/video distortion & transitions: **OGL** or
  **curtains.js** (shader hover/scroll warps) — only when the concept earns it.

Pattern: Lenis for smooth scroll → GSAP ScrollTrigger for choreography →
SplitType for headline reveals → Swiper for any carousel. Gate everything behind
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Modern CSS effects (no library needed)

- **Image & video masks:** `mask-image` / `-webkit-mask` with a gradient or a
  generated alpha shape; `clip-path` (polygon, circle, shapes) for angled/
  organic crops; `mask-composite` for cutouts.
- **Blend & tone:** `mix-blend-mode` (screen/overlay for glow), `background-blend-mode`,
  duotone via a tinted layer + blend, `backdrop-filter` glassmorphism.
- **Scroll-driven (native):** `animation-timeline: view()` / `scroll()` with
  `@keyframes` for reveal/parallax with zero JS (progressive enhancement).
- **Large-image placement:** full-bleed `object-fit: cover` heroes, art-directed
  `<picture>` for breakpoints, oversized images bleeding past the container with
  `width: 100vw; margin-inline: calc(50% - 50vw)`, `aspect-ratio` to reserve
  space (no layout shift), CSS `@property` + `conic-gradient` for animated rings,
  `background-clip: text` gradient headlines, sticky image + scrolling copy.
- Video as texture: muted/loop/playsinline `<video>` behind `mix-blend-mode` or
  a `mask`, framed in device mockups, or as a masked accent shape.

## Push to super high-end (the difference between good and expensive)

Great assets aren't enough — these details are what make a page read as premium.
Apply most of them on every build:

**1. Typography (biggest lever).** Don't ship Inter-only. Pair a characterful
**display** font with a clean body (e.g. a refined serif — Playfair/Fraunces — or
a distinctive grotesk for the headings; Inter for body). Use a **fluid type
scale** and tight display tracking:
```css
h1{ font-size:clamp(44px,7vw,104px); letter-spacing:-.03em; line-height:1.02; }
h2{ font-size:clamp(30px,4.6vw,58px); letter-spacing:-.02em; }
.lede{ font-size:clamp(17px,1.6vw,22px); line-height:1.6; }
```
Load via Google Fonts (preconnect) or vendor. One display + one body, no more.

**2. Generous space & rhythm.** High-end = air. Section padding
`clamp(80px,12vw,160px)`, large gaps, a consistent spacing scale (8/12/16/24/
40/64/96). Don't crowd. Let the hero breathe.

**3. Real motion choreography (make it the default, not an afterthought).** Wire
the premium stack instead of basic fades: **Lenis** (smooth scroll) + **GSAP +
ScrollTrigger** (staggered reveals, pinned sections, scrub-linked parallax,
number tickers) + **SplitType** (headline word/char reveals). Swiper for any
carousel. Gate on `prefers-reduced-motion`. This single upgrade does the most for
"feels expensive."

**4. Depth, light & texture.**
- Layered, soft shadows (not one harsh box-shadow):
  `box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.18), 0 20px 50px rgba(0,0,0,.30);`
- A subtle **grain/noise overlay** over the whole page lifts everything:
  ```css
  body::after{ content:""; position:fixed; inset:0; z-index:9999;
    pointer-events:none; opacity:.05; mix-blend-mode:overlay;
    background-image:url("assets/img/noise.png"); }   /* tiny tiled noise PNG */
  ```
- Colored glows behind focal elements (`filter: drop-shadow` / blurred radial),
  gradient-mesh / animated `@property` conic backgrounds, glassmorphism done with
  real `backdrop-filter` + 1px light border + inset highlight.

**5. Detail polish.** Themed scrollbars, custom `::selection`, visible focus
rings, hover lift+glow on every interactive thing, animated counters, a sticky
nav that condenses on scroll, tasteful cursor/tilt accents. Consistent radius +
shadow tokens.

**6. Colour.** Restrained accent + rich neutrals; use `color-mix()` for tints;
duotone hero imagery via blend modes; never more than ~2 accent hues.

## Make graphics & icons LARGE (impact over timidity)

Undersized graphics read as cheap. Go bigger than feels safe:
- **Feature/step icons:** 64–96px (not 24–32). Hero/section accent icons larger.
- **Accent graphics** (orbs, 3D shapes, blobs, mascots, product cut-outs): huge —
  often 40–70% of the viewport, bleeding off the edges, layered behind/around
  copy with parallax. A mascot at the final CTA can be 200–360px+.
- **Headline graphics:** dominant — let them own the hero.
- **Hero/product imagery:** full-bleed or large framed; use `object-fit:cover`,
  oversized bleeds (`width:100vw; margin-inline:calc(50% - 50vw)`), big rounded
  frames with layered shadow. Generate stills at high res so they stay crisp big.

## Best background removal
Use **`tools/fal.py bg`** (default `fal-ai/birefnet/v2`) — SOTA matting with soft
anti-aliased alpha (0–255), clean on hair/edges, keeps subject colours that match
the backdrop. Always follow with `tools/imgkit.py alpha` to trim/resize. (Generate
the subject at high resolution so the cutout stays sharp when placed large.)

## Buttons: ONE great image CTA + CSS buttons for the rest

Rendering every button as an image is what made past templates look off. The rule:

- **Exactly one hero/primary CTA is a generated image** — the single most
  important conversion button (reuse that same image for the final CTA if you
  like). Make it genuinely excellent.
- **Every other button is a crafted CSS button** (nav, secondary, pricing,
  ghost). CSS buttons stay crisp at any size, recolour instantly, and never show
  matting artefacts.

### The one image CTA — use Recraft V3
Generate buttons with **`fal-ai/recraft-v3`** (a design model) — it renders crisp
text *integrated into* the button far better than general text-image models, with
none of the flat "Arial-on-an-image" look. Recraft uses **`--imgsize WIDTHxHEIGHT`**
(not `--aspect`); pass a **wide** size or you get a circle. Then **`fal.py bg`** +
`imgkit alpha`. Place as `<a class="btn-cta"><img alt="<label>"></a>`; add hover/
press/glow in CSS only.
  ```bash
  python3 tools/fal.py image --model fal-ai/recraft-v3 --imgsize 1600x520 \
    --prompt "A premium glossy 3D call-to-action button, one wide horizontal rounded-rectangle <brand> gradient pill spanning the full width, soft bevel and warm sheen, the text '<LABEL>' in bold white on a SINGLE line, crisp professional UI, soft drop shadow, plain white background" \
    --out raw/btn-cta.jpg
  python3 tools/fal.py bg raw/btn-cta.jpg raw/btn-cta-cut.png
  python3 tools/imgkit.py alpha raw/btn-cta-cut.png assets/img/btn-cta.png --pad 6
  ```
  Generate **2–3 and keep the best** (crisp text, wide pill, label reads against
  its own fill). Mirror the visible words in `alt`.

  **Need several image buttons? Generate a SET and crop.** Ask Recraft for a
  vertical UI kit of 2–3 stacked buttons in one **portrait** image, bg-remove the
  whole sheet, then `imgkit crop --box` each band. One generation → a consistent
  family, better-sized than square one-offs:
  ```bash
  python3 tools/fal.py image --model fal-ai/recraft-v3 --imgsize 1000x1400 \
    --prompt "A clean UI kit of three identical wide rounded-rectangle <brand> gradient buttons stacked vertically with even spacing, each glossy with bold white centered text on one line — 'LABEL ONE', 'LABEL TWO', 'LABEL THREE', crisp UI, plain white background" --out raw/btnset.jpg
  python3 tools/fal.py bg raw/btnset.jpg raw/btnset-cut.png
  python3 tools/imgkit.py crop raw/btnset-cut.png assets/img/btn-1.png --box "0,0,1,0.34" --size 900
  python3 tools/imgkit.py crop raw/btnset-cut.png assets/img/btn-2.png --box "0,0.34,1,0.67" --size 900
  python3 tools/imgkit.py crop raw/btnset-cut.png assets/img/btn-3.png --box "0,0.67,1,1" --size 900
  ```
  (Recraft is also the better engine for **headline graphics**, icons, and logos.)

  **Match the button style to the template — don't reuse one look.** Each brand
  gets its own finish: embossed polished metal (gold/rose-gold/chrome), glossy
  glass/gel, soft matte 3D, candy gloss, neon-outline, or flat editorial keyline.
  Derive it from `brand.json` (palette + mood). **Whatever the style, render the
  TEXT in that same material** — embossed/engraved/extruded and catching the same
  light — never a flat sans-serif pasted on top (that "Arial-over-an-image" look
  is the #1 tell of a cheap button). The text must look *made of* the button.

### The CSS buttons (everything else)
Build one strong reusable `.btn` (+ `.btn-ghost`, sizes) from the brand colours —
designed, not default. The inset highlight + coloured glow + hover lift is what
makes it premium. **Pick the label colour from the fill, not habit:** light/gold/
pastel fills take **dark** ink (≥ 4.5:1), deep fills take light ink; check the
hover and ghost states too (a ghost label that inherits a page colour can vanish
on its hover background).
  ```css
  .btn { display:inline-flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; gap:8px;
    padding:14px 28px; border:0; border-radius:999px; font-weight:800; cursor:pointer;
    color:#fff; background:linear-gradient(180deg,var(--accent),var(--accent-deep));
    box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,.35), 0 10px 26px var(--accent-glow);
    transition:transform .16s, box-shadow .16s, filter .16s; }
  .btn:hover { transform:translateY(-2px); filter:brightness(1.05);
    box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,.4), 0 16px 36px var(--accent-glow); }
  .btn:active { transform:translateY(0); }
  .btn:focus-visible { outline:3px solid var(--accent-glow); outline-offset:3px; }
  .btn-ghost { background:transparent; color:var(--ink); border:1px solid var(--line); box-shadow:none; }
  ```

## Headline graphics (make the hero stand out)

Plain text is fine for most sections, but the **hero (and key section headers)
deserve a headline graphic** — a designed treatment CSS text can't match. You can
fold a small course/product graphic (ebook, play badge) into the lockup so type +
icon read as one piece. Two approaches:

- **Typographic headline image** (`fal-ai/ideogram/v3` or `recraft-v3`): the key
  phrase rendered with a gradient / 3D / chrome / foil treatment on a plain
  background → `fal.py bg` → place as an `<img>` with the real text in `alt`, plus
  a visually-hidden heading for SEO/AX. Keep it SHORT; regenerate until the
  spelling is perfect. **Prefer a LANDSCAPE (wide) aspect** — headlines sit wide
  in a hero/section, so a 16:9-ish graphic fits and centers far better than a tall
  square; center it in its container.
- **No eyebrow over a headline.** Don't stack a small kicker label directly above
  the headline — it dates the design and competes with the graphic. Lead with the
  headline; if a kicker is essential, fold it into the copy or a separate badge.
- **Text + accent graphic:** keep the headline as CSS text but add a large
  generated graphic behind/around it (gradient orb, 3D object, underline swash,
  glow shape) so it pops.

Either way, lift it with **CSS**: `filter: drop-shadow(0 14px 30px <glow>)` on the
graphic, gradient `background-clip:text` on accent words, `text-wrap:balance`, and
a soft glow layer. A bold headline with drop-shadow + glow reads premium.

## Badges, seals & small text graphics
- **Badges / seals / emblems** → generate on a plain background, `fal.py bg`. For
  a seal with a number ("30 DAYS"), generate the empty medallion and overlay the
  number as HTML so it stays crisp.
- **One-off display text** (a sticker, a stamp) → `fal-ai/ideogram/v3`; it's
  inconsistent run-to-run, so **Read the result and regenerate** until correct.

## Character / host / mascot pattern

To put a creator/host (a person) or a brand mascot on the page:

1. Generate the character/mascot on a plain background → **`fal.py bg` →
   `imgkit alpha`** → a clean transparent cutout. Use it large and recurring
   (corner widget, hero, section breaks, final CTA). For a mascot, generate poses.
2. The sticky widget (bottom-right): cutout + a generated play-badge graphic +
   tooltip, wired to a **video modal**.
3. **The modal embeds a real YouTube video** (placeholder ID) — NOT a generated
   clip. A CTA button sits under the video. Esc / × / click-outside close; clear
   the iframe `src` on close so it stops playing.
   ```html
   <div class="modal-video">
     <iframe src="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?rel=0"
       title="Intro" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   </div>
   ```
   On open set `iframe.src = iframe.dataset.src + '&autoplay=1'`; on close set
   `iframe.src = ''`.

Reserve generated `fal.py video` for *enhancing graphics* — animated accent
areas, vertical feature loops, a subtle mascot bob — not for modal content.

## Polish: no orphan words

Headlines and subheads must never end on a lone word/short phrase:

- `text-wrap: balance` on every `h1/h2/h3`; `text-wrap: pretty` on body copy.
- Tie trailing short phrases with `&nbsp;` ("a tank of&nbsp;gas", "you already&nbsp;fish").
- Use intentional `<br>` for two-line display headlines so the break is designed,
  not accidental. Re-check at 360 / 768 / 1280 — a balanced desktop line can still
  orphan on mobile.

## Acceptance

- Every asset passes the glance test: instant impact, strong focal point, rich
  color, readable silhouette — no generic/washed-out/cluttered frames.
- Hero motion is a smooth, seamless, web-weight loop with a poster fallback.
- The page reads as a premium, graphics-led marketing experience, not a document.
